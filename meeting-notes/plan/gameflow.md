# Cmake to run the game 

# Looby:
- Max 4 racer at a time 
- Choose my name and represent character (cat, dog, buffalo, dragon, snake)
- Choose vehicles which have different properties (speed, power)
- Add bot/ add human player 
- Choose map (from a collection or random) 
- PLay! 

# In game  
- 1..2..3 go! 
- User race by keyboard 
- How to win: the first racer finish 5 rounds in 15min-> end the race
- Fixed and random booster around the race 
- Scoreboard: time, how many rounds 
- Return to lobby at addbot state 
 
## handle stupid situation
- If no action in 5min, popup "Are you there?". If no response in 30s, loser. reason: out of juice
